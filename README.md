How to see the story/sprites:

STEP ONE: Download and unzip the folder
STEP TWO: Copy and paste both files in the zip into the Loves Truck "game" folder (the folder literally named "game", not the folder with the Loves Truck executable)
STEP THREE: There is no three. Just run the executable now and you'll see the new story - The Journalist and JD - available.
